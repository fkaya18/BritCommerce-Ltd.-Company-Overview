## Annual Revenue and Profit Chart

The Annual Revenue and Profit chart shows BritCommerce Ltd.'s financial performance over three years, with total revenue growing from $68M in 2022 to $80M in 2023 (an 18% increase), then declining to $73M in 2024 (a 9% drop). Profit margins remained relatively stable across the period, with profits of $16M in 2022, $18M in 2023, and $17M in 2024, maintaining consistent profitability ratios around 23-24%. The 2023 peak represents the company's strongest performance year, generating $98M in combined revenue and profit, but the 2024 contraction suggests emerging challenges that interrupted the growth trajectory. This revenue decline, despite maintaining healthy profit margins, indicates potential market pressures or competitive challenges that require strategic intervention to restore growth momentum.

## Revenue by Year and Month Chart
The Revenue by Year and Month chart reveals distinct seasonal patterns with BritCommerce experiencing peak performance in May and December 2023, reaching approximately $8.5M, while experiencing a notable summer decline with July 2023 hitting a low point around $5.5M. The company recovered strongly by December 2023, but faced a sharp downturn in early 2024 with January and February showing significant drops to around $5.2M. Throughout 2024, the revenue pattern shows continued volatility with peaks in August and December reaching $7M-$7.5M, but experiencing troughs in February and September at approximately $5.3M. This pattern suggests BritCommerce's business is influenced by specific seasonal factors that differ from traditional retail cycles, with summer months being particularly challenging and strong performance occurring during spring (May) and winter holiday periods (December), indicating the need for targeted strategies during these predictable low-demand periods.
