# ðŸ§© Schema Description
The SQL code establishes a comprehensive database system for BritCommerceLtd with three interconnected tables, implementing advanced customer segmentation through CTEs and automated profit calculations. The implementation includes robust data validation protocols and enriches the dataset with analytical dimensions such as customer segments, age categories, and profitability metrics to enable sophisticated business intelligence and marketing analytics.

You can access the SQL codes used to accomplish all this [here](BritCommerceLtd.sql).

BritCommerce's database follows a classic e-commerce structure with three core tables: products (storing product details, costs, and pricing), customers (containing demographic and segmentation data), and sales (capturing transaction records). The sales table serves as the central hub, linking products and customers through foreign key relationships while storing essential transaction data including quantities, payments, and calculated profits.

# Key Insights

## Financial Performance

**Revenue Trajectory Concerns:** BritCommerce achieved peak performance in 2023 with $80M revenue (+17.67% YoY), but experienced significant decline in 2024 to $73M (-8.55%), indicating potential market challenges or competitive pressures requiring immediate attention.

**Seasonal Revenue Volatility:** The company exhibits extreme seasonal fluctuations with May and December representing peak months ($26.8M-$27M) while February consistently underperforms ($17.7M), creating predictable cash flow challenges throughout the year.

**Profit Margin Stability:** Despite revenue volatility, BritCommerce maintains consistent profit margins around 22-24%, demonstrating operational efficiency and effective cost management across all business cycles.

## Product Portfolio Performance

**Volume vs. Profitability Disconnect:** The best-selling product (Product_6028_WEWBO) generates only 19.32% profit margin compared to the company average of 29.58%, highlighting a critical misalignment between popular products and profitable ones.

**Category Concentration Risk:** BritCommerce shows heavy dependence on Toys and Home&Kitchen categories for revenue generation. The 2024 decline in these dominant categories highlights the risk of over-reliance on specific product lines, despite consistent profitability margins across the portfolio.

**Product Line Diversification:** With 30,000 products across 15 categories, BritCommerce has achieved portfolio breadth, but the narrow profit margin range (22.28%-23.55%) suggests limited pricing differentiation strategies.


## Customer Demographics and Behavior

**Young Demographic Dominance:** Nearly 60% of customers fall within 18-35 age groups (35.95% aged 26-35, 24.04% aged 18-25), indicating strong digital-native market penetration but potential vulnerability to demographic shifts.

**High-Value Customer Concentration:** High Spenders generate $97.42M (44% of total revenue) despite representing only 14.84% of customers, creating significant revenue dependency on a small customer segment.

**Geographic Market Concentration:** Strong UK and German market presence with European diversification, but limited penetration in Nordic and Eastern European markets represents untapped growth opportunities.

## Operational Patterns

**Weekly Order Distribution:** Monday emerges as peak ordering day (19,000 orders) with mid-week strength, while weekends show significant drop-offs, indicating B2B or work-related purchasing patterns.

**Payment Method Diversification:** Credit cards dominate (39.9% of orders, $88.5M revenue) but consistent average order values across all payment methods ($2,221-$2,256) suggest effective payment strategy implementation.

**Gender-Based Spending Patterns:** Female customers consistently outspend males across segments, particularly among High Spenders, indicating potential for targeted gender-based marketing strategies.



# Recommendations

## Revenue Growth and Stability

**Implement Counter-Seasonal Strategies:** Develop targeted promotional campaigns and product launches during historically weak months (February, September) to smooth revenue volatility and improve cash flow predictability.

**Diversify Revenue Streams:** Reduce dependency on Toys and Home&Kitchen categories by strategically expanding high-margin segments like Gaming, Books, and Snacks & Chocolates that show superior profitability rates.

**Geographic Expansion Initiative:** Prioritize market development in Nordic and Eastern European countries where current customer presence is limited but market potential exists based on demographic and economic indicators.

## Product Portfolio Optimization

**Repricing Strategy for Volume Leaders:** Conduct comprehensive pricing analysis for high-volume, low-margin products like Product_6028_WEWBO to improve profitability without significantly impacting sales volume.

**Product Line Rationalization:** Evaluate underperforming products within the 30,000-product portfolio and consider discontinuing items that fail to meet minimum profitability thresholds to optimize operational efficiency.

## Customer Segmentation and Retention

**Champions Segment Development:** Implement loyalty programs and exclusive offerings to convert High Spenders and Loyal customers into Champions, as this segment represents only 1.52% of the customer base despite high potential value.

**Age Demographic Expansion:** Develop targeted marketing campaigns for 45+ age groups who currently represent smaller customer segments but may have higher disposable income and loyalty potential.

**Value Seeker Monetization:** Create tiered pricing strategies and value-added services for the 25.7% Value Seeker segment to increase their average order value without losing price sensitivity appeal.

## Operational Efficiency Improvements

**Weekend Sales Optimization:** Develop weekend-specific marketing campaigns and promotions to capitalize on the significant drop in Saturday orders and boost overall weekly performance.

**Payment Method Optimization:** Promote adoption of lower-cost digital payment methods while maintaining the current successful multi-payment approach that ensures consistent order values across all channels.

**Female Customer Focus:** Leverage the identified gender spending patterns by developing female-targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations, particularly for high-margin categories.

## Strategic Performance Monitoring

**Monthly Performance Dashboards:** Implement real-time monitoring systems for the identified seasonal patterns to enable proactive management of inventory, marketing spend, and cash flow during predictable 
fluctuation periods.

**Margin Monitoring by Category:** Establish automated alerts for profit margin changes by product line to quickly identify and address pricing or cost issues before they impact overall profitability.

**Customer Lifetime Value Tracking:** Develop sophisticated analytics to track customer migration between segments and identify early warning signs of High Spender attrition to protect revenue concentration risks.
