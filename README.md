# ðŸ§© Schema Description
The SQL code establishes a comprehensive database system for BritCommerceLtd with three interconnected tables, implementing advanced customer segmentation through CTEs and automated profit calculations. The implementation includes robust data validation protocols and enriches the dataset with analytical dimensions such as customer segments, age categories, and profitability metrics to enable sophisticated business intelligence and marketing analytics.

You can access the SQL codes used to accomplish all this [here](BritCommerceLtd.sql).

BritCommerce's database follows a classic e-commerce structure with three core tables: products (storing product details, costs, and pricing), customers (containing demographic and segmentation data), and sales (capturing transaction records). The sales table serves as the central hub, linking products and customers through foreign key relationships while storing essential transaction data including quantities, payments, and calculated profits.

# Recommendations

* **Address Year-over-Year Decline:** Implement immediate strategic interventions to reverse the -8.55% YoY decline by conducting comprehensive market analysis, competitor benchmarking, and customer retention programs while leveraging the positive 18.14% month-over-month growth momentum to build sustainable recovery strategies.

* **Optimize Seasonal Marketing Campaigns:** Capitalize on strong December ($22M) and May ($21M) performance patterns by developing targeted seasonal campaigns, pre-loading inventory for peak months, and creating special promotions during low-performance periods like February ($14M) to smooth revenue volatility throughout the year.

* **Enhance High Spender Segment Focus:** Given that High Spenders generate $97.42M revenue with only 10,138 customers, develop premium loyalty programs, personalized shopping experiences, and exclusive product offerings to increase this segment's size and spending frequency while maintaining their high-value contribution.

* **Expand Gaming Category Presence:** With Gaming showing the highest profit margin at 30.19% despite fewer products, significantly expand this category's product portfolio to capture more market share and leverage its superior profitability compared to other categories.

* **Strengthen Female Customer Engagement:** Since 55% of customers are female and show consistent engagement across all segments, develop female-focused marketing campaigns, product curation, and user experience improvements while creating targeted approaches for male customers who demonstrate higher premium segment spending.

* **Optimize Payment Method Strategy:** While credit cards dominate ($88.5M revenue), actively promote and incentivize emerging payment methods like cryptocurrency ($11.3M from 5,026 orders) and mobile payments to capture tech-savvy customers and reduce transaction fees.

* **Leverage Weekday Sales Patterns:** With Tuesday showing peak performance (18.9K orders), implement weekday-specific promotional strategies, optimize inventory management for Monday-Wednesday peak periods, and develop weekend engagement campaigns to boost Saturday-Sunday sales performance.

* **International Market Expansion:** Build upon strong European presence in France, Germany, and Italy by developing localized marketing strategies, currency options, and region-specific product offerings to increase market penetration and reduce dependence on UK market performance.

* **Cross-Category Product Bundling:** With top sellers spanning Automotive, Toys, Electronics, and Home&Kitchen, create strategic product bundles across categories to increase average order value from the current $2.24K and encourage customers to explore diverse product segments.

* **Customer Journey Optimization:** Analyze the progression from Value Seekers (11,798 customers) to High Spenders (10,138 customers) to develop targeted upgrade campaigns, loyalty rewards, and personalized recommendations that accelerate customer lifecycle advancement and increase lifetime value.
